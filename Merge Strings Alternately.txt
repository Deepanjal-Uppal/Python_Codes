PROBLEM:

You are given two strings word1 and word2. 
Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. 
If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.




SOLUTION:

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        l=min(len(word1),len(word2))
        s=""

        for i in range(0,l):
            s=s+word1[i]+word2[i]
        

        if len(word1) > len(word2):
            for i in range(l,len(word1)):
                s=s+word1[i]
        elif len(word1) < len(word2):
            for i in range(l,len(word2)):
                s=s+word2[i]
        
        return s
